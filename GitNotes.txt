Notes for Github - A refresher!!!!

I need to set it up 

Git  - Version Control System - used for my managment of source control.

install git

download git from 

https://git-scm.com/downloads

Config our username and email

global refers to current user

git config --global user.name "naj"

git config --global user .email "najdhillon@gmail.com"

if one runs into this issue on a mac Agreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires admin privileges, please re-run as root via sudo.

simply open xcode on your mac and make sure you are logged in!

git config --list - shows username and email

git help - in bash the actual help feature

ex. git help commit

it will launch a browser with commit help page

Creating our First Repository

pwd - shows the current location

cd .. - jump a folder back
cd folder - jump into the folder

initialize a repo

once you are in the folder you want to work out of than one simply enters

git init

ls -la - shows you all the hidden files

adding all the files that have been made

git add .

than we commit

git commit -m "Message being added to the commit" (takes a snapshot)

Adding files and the Commit Log

git log - shows your last commits

if one is stuck in the scrollable formation of the commit logs than one simply needs to press q to get out



viewing commits from a particular dev or user

git log --author="username"

if it can't find someone than it will disappear

git status - compares repo versus the repo for changes

Git workflow

git add second.txt(example text file or file in general)
